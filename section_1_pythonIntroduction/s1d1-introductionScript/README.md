# Hello world from Python!

The Hello World program is usually the first program any programmer writes. It is basically a program that prints the phrase "Hello World!" to the terminal. To do this, you just need the following line of code in your python script or python terminal.

```python
print('Hello world!')
```

In section 1 you will learn how to create a Python script and set the previous line of code. And in section 2 you will find the different ways to execute Python code. 

# 1. Creating a python script


## 2. Executing python code

The Python code can be executed in two ways. **Firstly**, you can create a Python script, which is basically a plain text file with a *.py* extension. Write your Python code inside and then execute it by calling *python* from your terminal/powershell. See the following command 

```python 
python helloWorld.py
```


**Second**, you can open your Python terminal, type or copy and paste your code there, and see each line of code executed one at a time. 

To open your Python terminal, type the word *python* or *python3* into your terminal. You will see a message similar to the following

```python

Python 3.12.7 (tags/v3.12.7:0b05ead, Oct  1 2024, 03:06:41) [MSC v.1941 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 
>>>
```

after the symbol '>>>' you can write and execute your code.
