# 1. Introduction to Python :snake: and some clarifications 

## 1.1 Who developed Python :snake:? and why? 

The Python programming language was developed by Guido Van Rossum, in the late 80's [1]. The aim of this development was to create a successor to the ABC-programming language. The main characteristics for this new language were that it had to be intuitive, understandable, suitable for everyday tasks and open source [2]. The release to the public was made in 1991 and since then Python has evolved to become one of the most widely used programming languages. 

You will find that Python is flexible and that you can easily approach tasks related to web development, data science, machine learning, computer vision and more.

## 1.2 Some important information before we start coding

Before we start coding I would like to introduce you to: how looks the structure of a python project, what is a virtual environment and to the Python's :snake: package :package: administrator.
